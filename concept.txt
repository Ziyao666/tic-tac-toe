React:
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library 
for building user interfaces.

Component:
A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), 
and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children.

React components can have state by setting this.state in their constructors. 
this.state should be considered as private to a React component that 
it’s defined in.

All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a 
super(props) call.
